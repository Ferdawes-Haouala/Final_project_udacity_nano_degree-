> Summary of data wrangling steps that I performed before I started my exploration.

I chose the columns that I will work on (their topic is work and demographics)
I renamed the columns to become more meaningful
I changed the data types and made some modifications before that


## Summary of Findings

> relationship between life satisfaction, sex and age

- female have a higher life satisfaction rate than men espacialy for those aged between 18 and 70 but 75% have a life satisfaction rate above 5 

> relationship between work satisfaction, country and age

- for france and turkey 25% of respondants whose age is between 30 and 50 are satisfied from their work (7 to 8 rating) in france 75% of respondants whose age is between 18 and 30 are quite to not satisfied with the work (rating less than 7)

> relationship between life satisfaction, work satisfaction and work importance

- there seems to be a negative relationship between respondants who see work as not important and they are satisfied with their work and their life 
but at the same time there seems to be a positive relation between people who are satisfied with their work and life but they don't find work impotant
it maybe that preceiving work as important gives you more stress, whereas people who are satisifed in the work it is not because of the impotance of work it is because of their life satisfaction
so the more satisfied someone is in his overall life that may lead to work satisfaction
Needs further investigation

> relationship between work satisfaction, work importance and sex

- male respondants who preceive work as very important have the highest average rate of work satisfaction


> relationship between work satisfaction, work importance and sex

- It seems like men tend to value work more as important and they tend to feel it is more satisfiying

- There seems to be a positive relationship between male respondants' freedom of choice and their work satisfaction given that work is not important to them


> relationship between work satisfaction and country 

- workers in Turkey seems to be more unsatisfied in their life(rate = 0) than those in Germany and France but maybe if we sum other rates (1,2,3) they can have closer unsatisfaction rate 

> relationship between work importance/ work satisfaction and country 

- people aged 30 to 50 value work more than other ages

- People aged between 50 and 70 are more unsatisfied with their work then people aged between18 and 30
As if the more you get older the more unsatisfied you are 
- from another perspective people aged between 30 and 50 have a higher satisfaction wrok rate than those aged between 18 and 30 and those aged between 50 and 70

> relationship between work criterias and work satisfaction

- people who consider pay as important in a job are more unsatisfied with their work 
- people who consider security as immpotant to have in a job are more unsatisfied than others 
- people who did not mention holdiay as important for a job are more unsatisfied
it maybe that when you focus on money you can't be satisfied with the work or when you focus on security you feel unsecure and not satisfied but we can not assert these statement

whereas, when people did not mention holiday as important in their work they then felt unsatisfied more : maybe because they didn't ask for holidays or they did not rest and benefited from payed_from_work holidays 



## Key Insights for Presentation
> which cateogry of ages is more satisfied with work : between 30 and 50

> What makes your epmolyees satisfied : maybe life satisfaction 

>importance to work may not lead to satisfaction for employees

> How to recruit employees that become satisfied and may pay more importance to work : maybe based on gender (male) and freedom of choice

       because there are men who don't see work as important but they get more and more satisfied with work the more freedom                                             of choice they get
    
>importance to work may not lead to satisfaction for employees

>Turkey has less unsatisfaction life rate and higher life satisfaction rate
